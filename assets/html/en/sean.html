    <h1>Sean Gourley</h1>
    <p>Sean Gourley, the worthy son of Jimmy, pursues and stretches his father’s work with the same refinement and profound love for bebop and the old songs.</p>
    <p>As guitarist and singer, he likes to offer song and dance oriented jazz for all, essentially inspired by Frank Sinatra, Nat King Cole and show tunes.</p>
    <p>He has illustrated his musical approach for the past fifteen years with his band, the Sean Gourley Group. He also is an appreciated accompanist, having worked with singers Stéphane Sanseverino, Jil Caplan, Marcos Adam, Lexie Kendrick, Manda Djinn and Stephanie Crawford, as well as with famed musicians such as Barney Wilen, Steve Potts, Turk Mauro, Eddy Louiss and of course his father, Jimmy Gourley.</p>
