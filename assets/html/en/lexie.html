    <h1>Lexie Kendrick</h1>
    <p>Lexie Kendrick is a professional jazz-pop singer based in the City of Light since 2001.</p>
    <p>The Alabama-native’s voice has been described as silky-smooth sultry...truly a slice of heaven to hear.* Her unique talents can be discovered in the generosity of her delivery, whether she is interpreting folk or country songs, jazz standards or show tunes. Her storytelling quality served by her intense dynamic abilities makes it that she addresses her audience as if she was singing the melody to each and every member in the room personally.**</p>
    <p>For Lexie, music is synonymous with family; from parents who imparted their love of the 1960’s British Invasion to her musician grandfather’s influence of jazz standards and western swing. Needless to say, Lexie’s taste is eclectic and she enjoys collaborating with artists of all genres, in a variety of ways such as songwriting/co-writing (60s SUNSHINE POP for Universal Production Music Fr), text adaptation and translation, and musical theatre creations (NEW the improvised musical, Alex Lutz-Seul en scène).</p>
    <p>From 2007 to 2017, Lexie was lead singer in the Franco-American quintet, The Don LaRue Combo, led by guitarist, Sean Gourley (son of Jimmy Gourley, guitarist for the Kenny Clarke Trio). Over the group's ten-year period they performed all over Europe and recorded 4 albums, selling thousands of copies worldwide.</p>
    <p>Since 2013, she is thrilled to be singing at the famous cabaret, the Moulin Rouge, entertaining guests during the dinner-show before the stage show Féerie with an eclectic repertoire of French and International chart-topping hits and jazz standards from the Great American Songbook. Her vocal versatility ensures her regular work as a voice actress (cartoons, commercials, documentaries and dubbings) as well as a professional singer, having recorded for EMI France, Walt Disney France, Warner Music and Sony Music France.</p>
    <p>You can currently find Lexie making regular appearances with musical and theatrical acts throughout France (Heure Bleue Trio, Broadway Ensemble, Les Jingle Belles, The French Mademoiselles). Her latest jazz album, Almost Blue, with the group KLGO featuring an original tune and jazz-pop covers is available in hard copy and on all digital platforms. 2021 marks the birth of a new folk-pop duo, Phil & Lexie, with award-winning French musician/singer/composer/musical director, Philippe Uminski (Johnny Hallyday, Julien Clerc, Calogero…)</p>
